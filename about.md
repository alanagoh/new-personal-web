**Hello!** You've stumbled upon my little corner of the web where I post mainly Year in Reviews to keep track of life.  


My all-time favourite quote that I come back to repeatedly: 

>As we let our light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence actually liberates others. <cite>Marianne Williamson</cite>

I send newsletters irregularly on Substack: [Your Internet Friend](http://yourinternetfriend.substack.com/ "Your Internet Friend")


*Thank you for reading!*
